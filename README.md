## Project Overview

The **Bus Shelter Design IRHS** repository contains the complete engineering files, 3D models, renders, presentation boards, and poster artwork for the “ArcWave Station” concept bus stop. Designed as part of a Grade 11 architectural and digital media assignment, the shelter integrates cutting-edge environmental technologies and passenger-centric amenities. It aims to:

- Leverage renewable energy for off-grid operation  
- Enhance passenger comfort with dynamic seating and climate control  
- Provide real-time schedule information on transparent OLED panes  
- Improve safety through smart surveillance and emergency systems  
- Use sustainable materials and efficient form-finding for minimal environmental impact  

Whether you’re an architecture student, transit planner, or digital designer, this repository showcases end-to-end design development—from initial sketches and research, through 3D modeling, to final renderings and documentation.

### User Interviews & Insights

1. **Shelter Identification**  
   - Clear signage needed; current stops lack distinct numbering.  
2. **Weather Protection**  
   - Glass canopies on rainy days become hot/​stuffy in summer—ventilation & shading critical.  
3. **Seating Preferences**  
   - Benches preferred; foldable backs enhance comfort and space efficiency.  
4. **Lighting & Safety**  
   - Street lights exist but real-time display and emergency button improve after-dark security.  
5. **Accessibility**  
   - Partial ramp integration for strollers and wheelchairs.  
6. **Amenities**  
   - USB charging, free Wi-Fi, and waste bins highly valued; bicycle racks deemed optional.  
7. **Thermal Comfort**  
   - Insulated glazing keeps shelter warm in winter and cool in summer, boosting passenger satisfaction.

All original audio recordings and transcripts are uploaded within the `interviews/` folder.
